WDN - Workout Development Network is a loosely based clone of MDN - Mozilla Developer Network. It contains a organized repository of exercises that make it easy for beginners or advanced workout enthusiasts to learn new exercises. Much like MDN does for learning different programming languages.

WDN is built with a Flask/SQLalchemy backend and the frontend rendering is handled with react. Its deployed on Render using a docker container and has full AWS integration for photos.
